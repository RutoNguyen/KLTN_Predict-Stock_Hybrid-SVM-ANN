# Prediction Stock Model Hybrid of SVM and ANN
A prediction model implemented using artificial neural networks and support vector machine.

# Algorithms Used
## Support Vector Machine
Support vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.

## Artificial Neural Networks
It is a multi-layered structure where every node in one layer is connected to every other node in the next layer. It consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. This model can be made deeper and more efficient by increasing the number of layers.

## Back Propogation
Backpropagation is a method used to train ANNs by calculating gradient needed to update network weights. It is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function.
